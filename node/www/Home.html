        The RobotRun software was developed at Michigan Technological University as part of a 
        collaborative initiative between MTU and Bay DeNoc Community College, and was made 
        possible by a generous grant from the National Science Foundation under the project 
        titled: University, Community College and Industry Partnership: Revamping Robotics 
        Education to Meet 21st Century Workforce Needs (Grant #DUE-1501335). Its goal was to 
        create a free, open-source software package for educational purposes. Robotic systems 
        are expensive and often unavailable to High school and community college students. While 
        simulations are a reasonable alternative, they can be very expensive. RobotRun is 
        a completely free and open source simulator designed to let students learn to 
        operate a robotic arm with out needing to own the arm itself. It is available for 
        download <a href="http://pages.mtu.edu/~kuhl/robotics/">here</a> or the source may be 
        downloaded and viewed <a href="https://github.com/skuhl/RobotRun/releases">here</a>. 
        Please note that RobotRun is designed for education and entertainment purposes only, 
        and therefore does NOT include any production features found in enterprise-level software. 
        RobotRun is not suitable for industrial use, and is not intended to replace any commercial 
        software tools. RobotRemote is an extension of RobotRun started in the summer of 
        2018. It is a web-based system designed to allow people who have used the RobotRun 
        software to test out what they have learned on a real robot. It allows users to 
        remotely control the real robotic arm that the software was based on.

<h2 style="text-align:  right;">How it works</h2>
      <p align="justify">
        RobotRemote works by allowing the user to remotely view one of the robotic 
        arms on the Michigan Tech campus, and control it using the interface on the 
        RobotRun website. Two cameras are aimed at the robot itself allowing it to be 
        viewed at multiple angles, while a third is a focused on the screen of the Teach 
        Pendant used to control the robot. A set of buttons on the control panel screen 
        made to replicate the Teach Pendant allows the user to input commands for the 
        arm. Each of the buttons on the website when pressed sends a signal, a triggers 
        an actuator to press the actual button on the Teach Pendant in the MTU robotics 
        lab.

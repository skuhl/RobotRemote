Background:
RobotRun is a NSF grant funded project that was started in the summer of 2015 
and grew in to the software available today. Its goal was to create a free, open-
source software package for educational purposes. Robotic systems are expensive 
and often unavailable to High school and community college students. While 
simulations are a reasonable alternative, they can be very expensive. RobotRun is 
a completely free and open source simulator designed to let students learn to 
operate a robotic arm with out needing to own the arm itself. It is available for 
download here [http://pages.mtu.edu/~kuhl/robotics/] or the source may be 
downloaded and viewed here [https://github.com/skuhl/RobotRun/releases]
RobotRemote is an extension of RobotRun started in the summer of 2018. It is a 
web-based system designed to allow people who have used the RobotRun 
software to test out what they have learned on a real robot. It allows users to 
remotely control the real robotic arm that the software was based on.

How it works:
RobotRemote works by allowing the user to remotely view one of the robotic 
arms on the Michigan Tech campus, and control it using the interface on the 
RobotRun website. Two cameras are aimed at the robot itself allowing it to be 
viewed at multiple angles, while a third is a focused on the screen of the Teach 
Pendant used to control the robot. A set of buttons on the control panel screen 
made to replicate the Teach Pendant allows the user to input commands for the 
arm. Each of the buttons on the website when pressed sends a signal, a triggers 
an actuator to press the actual button on the Teach Pendant in the MTU robotics 
lab.
